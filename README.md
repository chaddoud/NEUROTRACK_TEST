# NEUROTRACK_TEST
Simple simulation of a vending machine with change calculation

## TO RUN
This simple software runs in a terminal. No libraries were imported so, nothing else is needed to run it.
Just call python main.py from the root

### NEXT STEPS
- A class called Cart was created for future implementation of the shopping cart concept and with this, 
we could insert mthanthen one product in our orders.
- More calculations would be needed, for example, to check the total amount 
of money a customer must pay based on a different number of products
